How to execute :

What will be generated as output:
    In terminal : debug trace will be printed
    In output.txt : productions and corresponding line number will be printed

Changes made in grammar:
  -> As only a single postfix op is allowed in an expression so productions are changed as follows
     postfix_expression:
					primary_expression 
					|IDENTIFIER '[' expression ']' 
					|IDENTIFIER '(' argument_expression_list_optional ')' 
				  	|IDENTIFIER ARROW IDENTIFIER 
				  ;
